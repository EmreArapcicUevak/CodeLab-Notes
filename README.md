# CodeLab-Notes

CodeLab-Notes is a project for the subject [CS103](https://ecampus.ius.edu.ba/syllabus/cs103-introduction-programming).

## Project Overview 

CodeLab-Notes is a simple code editor that was made in around 13 \~ 15 days. It was worked on by [Emre Arapcic-Uevak](https://github.com/EmreArapcicUevak) & [Vedad Siljic](https://github.com/VedadSiljic) for their course graduation project. The application was made
using the [*QT Framework*](https://www.qt.io/).

* Auto save per tab change
* Different Syntax Highlighting
* Free used memory even on a faulty programm exit (preventing memory leaks)
